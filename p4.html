		<td>An operating system acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. It allows users to input data, process it, and access the output. Besides, through the operating system, users can communicate with computers to perform various functions such as arithmetic calculations and other significant tasks.</td>
		<td>When compared to the open-source platforms like Linux, some operating systems are costly. While users can use a free OS but generally they are a bit difficult to run than others. Moreover, operating systems such as Microsoft Windows with GUI functionality and other in-built features carry a costly price tag.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Windows operating system, when it came into existence, also introduces Graphical User Interface (GUI), which made using computers much more natural than earlier Command Line Interface. Moreover, users can quickly understand, interacts, and communicate with computer machines.</td>
		<td>If the central operating system fails, it will affect the whole system, and the computer will not work. Moreover, an OS is the heart of a computer system without which it cannot function. If the central system crashes, the whole communication will be halted, and there will be no further processing of data.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Operating systems allow the sharing of data and useful information with other users via Printers, Modems, Players, and Fax Machines. Besides, a single user can share the same data with multiple users at the corresponding time via mails. Also, various apps, images, and media files can be transferred from PC to other devices with the help of an operating system.</td>
		<td>Operating systems are highly complex, and the language which used to establish these OS are not clear and well defined. Besides, if there’s an issue with OS users cannot directly understand, and it cannot be resolved quickly.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>With the invention of GUI, operating systems allow accessing hardware without writing programs. Unlike, earlier users don’t have to write code of lines to access the hardware functionality of a computer system.</td>
		<td>Threats to the operating systems are higher as they are open to such virus attacks. Many users download malicious software packages on their system which halts the functioning of OS and slow it down.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>An operating system is a software which needs to update regularly to control high fleeting features that are continually increasing. With other apps and software hitting updates to improve their functionality, OS must improve their benchmarks and handle all the working of a computer. An OS can easily be updated without any complexity.</td>
		<td>Fragmentation in the computer is a state when storage memory breaks into pieces. Internal fragmentation occurs when the method of process is larger than the memory size. External fragmentation occurs when the method or process eliminates.</td>
