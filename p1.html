    <h2><li>Introduction to Operating system:</li></h2>
<h3>The OS operating system is the software that, after initially uploaded by an application application, manages all other application software in the computer. Application software benefits from the operating system by applying for services through API. In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as cli or GUI. The operating system functions as an interface between the user and the computer. The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which the programmes can be delivered in an appropriate and effective manner by the user. The operating system is a program that runs computers. The devices must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the proper operation of the computer system and prevent the user software from interfering with the proper operation of the system. The most common definition is that the operating system is the only program that operates at all times on the computer (usually called kernel), with all the other programs being apps. The operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices and information. The operating system, in contrast, includes resource management programs such as traffic control, scheduling, memory management module, input/release software and file system.</h3>
